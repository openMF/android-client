## A local fork of the material-navigation functionality from androidx.material

This library provides a navigation solution for Compose projects using Material3 BottomSheets. 
It allows you to define your BottomSheet as navigation routes, 
eliminating the need for the androidx.compose.material.navigation and  androidx.compose.material:material ! libraries.
This simplifies your app's dependencies and ensures a consistent Material3 experience.
This library also leverages the new functionality from androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.8.0-beta0X to allow you to define routes with serialized classes.
