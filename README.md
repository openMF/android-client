# Android Client for MifosX

This is an Android Application built on top of the [MifosX](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/MIFOSX/overview) platform and written in Java and Kotlin. It is based on Mifos X - a robust core banking platform that is developed for field officers using which they process transactions, keep track of their client’s data, center records, group details, different types of accounts (loan, savings, and recurring) of the client, run reports of clients, etc. Its sole purpose is to make field operations easier and effortless. This application also provides an offline feature that allows officers to connect with clients and provide them financial support in remote areas as well.

## Travis CI
<a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a> is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. We use Travis CI for continous integration and clean maintenance of code. All your pull requests must pass the CI build only then, it will be allowed to merge. Sometimes, when the build doesn't pass you can use these commands in your local terminal and check for the errors,</br>

For Mac OS and Linux based, you can use the following commands:

* `./gradlew checkstyle` quality checks on your project’s code using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.</br>
* `./gradlew pmd` a check and apply formatting to any plain-text file.</br>
* `./gradlew findbugs`  a program that uses static analysis to look for bugs in Java code.</br>
* `./gradlew build`  provides a command line to execute build script.</br>


For Windows, you can use the following commands:

* `gradlew checkstyle` quality checks on your project’s code using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.</br>
