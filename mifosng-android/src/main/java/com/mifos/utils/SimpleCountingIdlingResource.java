 * maintaining an internal counter. When the counter is 0 - it is considered to be idle, when it is
 * non-zero it is not idle. This is very similar to the way a {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}
 * behaves.
 * <p>
 * This class can then be used to wrap up operations that while in progress should block tests from
